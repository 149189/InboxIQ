InboxIQ backend scaffold created.
Apps:
- auth_app : custom user model, simple username/password register/login, Google OAuth connect.
- inboxiq_llm : LLM compose, window buffer memory in Redis, Draft model and Celery task to save to Gmail.

Important:
- For real deployment ensure HTTPS, secure state in OAuth flow, and encrypt tokens.
- Replace GEMINI placeholder with official Gemini calls per their SDK/docs.
